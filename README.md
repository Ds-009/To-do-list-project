Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple To-Do List application that helps users efficiently manage and organize their daily tasks. The application enables users to add, update, delete, search, and filter tasks while tracking due dates.

Description:
This Python-based To-Do List application is designed to provide a structured and user-friendly way to manage tasks. Built with object-oriented principles, the application allows users to store tasks with optional due dates. It features an intuitive text-based menu, allowing users to perform common task management operations, such as adding tasks, searching by keywords, or marking tasks as completed. The program ensures data integrity by validating inputs (e.g., dates) and offers flexibility with features like task updates.

Key Features:
Task Management: Add, update, and delete tasks.
Due Date Tracking: Optional due dates for tasks.
Search Functionality: Locate tasks using keywords.
Object-Oriented Design: Implements Task and ToDoList classes for maintainable code.
Text-Based Menu: Simple navigation for all operations.
Concepts Used:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation through Task and ToDoList classes.
Input Validation: Error handling for incorrect date formats.
Loops and Conditionals: Efficiently manage menu navigation.
List Manipulation: Dynamic task storage and processing.
