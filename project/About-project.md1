Project Title: To-Do List Application
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a basic console-based To-Do List application using Python. This application will allow users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. This project is aimed at strengthening Python fundamentals, understanding file handling, and enhancing problem-solving skills.
Description:
The To-Do List application will function as a simple task management system. Users will be able to:

- **Add Tasks**: Input task descriptions to be saved in the to-do list.
- **View Tasks**: Display the list of current tasks.
- **Update Tasks**: Modify task descriptions if needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed and differentiate between completed and pending tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list once they are no longer needed.
- **Save and Retrieve Data**: Use file handling to save tasks persistently, even after the program is closed.

**Key Features:**
1. **Task Management**: Add, view, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
2. **Persistent Storage**: Save tasks to a file (e.g., using JSON or text files) to retain data across sessions.
3. **Status Tracking**: Indicate task completion status.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure user-friendly prompts and error handling for invalid inputs.

**Technologies and Concepts Used:**

- Python fundamentals (functions, loops, and conditionals)
- File handling (to save tasks to a file and read them on program startup)
- Lists and dictionaries for data management
- Input validation and basic error handling

**Expected Outcome:**  
A console-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks conveniently. The project will enhance understanding of Python programming concepts, particularly in data management, file handling, and interactive application development.

**Future Enhancements:**  
For future development, this project could be expanded with a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter, task categorization, priority settings, and reminder notifications.
