'''Lab 6: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
1. Write a program to create a class called "Person" with a name and age attribute. Create two instances of the "Person" class, set their attributes using the constructor, and print their name and age. 
2. Create a class named 'Student' with String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'. Assign the value of roll no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student. 
3. Write a program to define a class to represent a bank account, with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.
4. Write a program to define a class Student with attributes like name and age, and create objects to represent different students.
